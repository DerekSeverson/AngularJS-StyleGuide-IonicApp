  - Provide a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as `acmeSalesCustomerInfo` which is declared in HTML as `acme-sales-customer-info`.

    *Why?*: The unique short prefix identifies the directive's context and origin. For example a prefix of `cc-` may indicate that the directive is part of a CodeCamper app while `acme-` may indicate a directive for the Acme company.

    Note: Avoid `ng-` as these are reserved for AngularJS directives. Research widely used directives to avoid naming conflicts, such as `ion-` for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).
