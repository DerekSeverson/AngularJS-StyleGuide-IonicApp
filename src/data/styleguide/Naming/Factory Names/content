  - Use consistent names for all factories named after their feature. Use camel-casing for services and factories.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference factories.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // logger.service.js
    angular
        .module
        .factory('logger', logger);

    function logger() { }
    ```
